# filescan
java library to scan files and directories 

This will be a file scanner for me to organize my downloads.  will catogorize the files based on keywords.
If it can't do that, then it puts into a general category.

Just thinking.  It also needs a keyword builder program that runs through the directory and fetches all words it finds
may get back to this!
